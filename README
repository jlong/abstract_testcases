Abstract TestCases for Rails
============================

This plugin allows you to suppress the "No tests were specified" failure for 
abstract test cases. To define an abstract test case, simply use the 
convenient class method:

  class MyAbstractTestCase < Test::Unit::TestCase
    
    # This is an abstract test case
    self.abstract_testcase = true
    
  end
